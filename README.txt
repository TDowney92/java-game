SNACK TIME: JAVASCRIPT GAME
   I choose a JavaScript canvas game because I have always been interested in web based games and I wanted to try it out myself and see if I could do it.  Another reason as to why I picked a canvas java game is because I was excited to draw all the pixel sprites I used in my game as well.
   I didn’t know much about canvas base coding when I first started this project, I have a little experience last year with an assignment but it wasn’t great to begin with though.
   The resources I used to make this project a success are as followed:
* http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/ this is the link I used to make the major portion of the game.
* https://www.pixilart.net/ this is the link I used to make all of my pixel sprites 

   One of the most challenging parts of this assignment would have to be finding the right “speed” for the hero sprite for the game.  It would either to fast or sluggishly slow, it took at least 3-4 adjustments to get it right.
